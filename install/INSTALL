# =======================================================================================    
Install Lighttpd and PHP5.x
  sudo pkg install lighttpd
  sudo pkg install php-52 (or any newer version if available)

# =======================================================================================    
See /path/to/SolarStatus/install/lighttpd.conf for a preconfigured lighttpd.conf
The file belongs into /etc/lighttpd/ or /etc/lighttpd/<version>/ depending on your system.
Be sure to backup any existing file first!

The bundled lighttpd.conf enables SSL on Port 443 and Fast-CGI for PHP5.

Please check the following directives inside the file:
  server.document-root   <- unpack SolarStatus into that directory
  server.errorlog
  var.php_bin-path
    
The bundled lighttpd.conf enables SSL/TLS,
to disable use the following directives:
  server.port = 80
  ssl.engine  = "disable"
    
To generate a self-signed certificate:
  openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 100 -nodes
    
It is important to set the common-name to the host or IP-address
 which you use to address your server.
Example:
  https://192.168.11.42/  "192.168.11.42" is your CN
  https://box/            "box" is your CN
  
Use the following to export your generated certiciate to an pfx file,
 which can be imported by windows et.al.
You have to import it into the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" store,
 then all major browsers should accept the SSL-connection.
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out knecht.pfx -in server.pem -name "MyBox"

See /path/to/SolarStatus/install/smf-svc-lighttpd.xml for a preconfigured service-descriptor for SMF
 ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Management_Facility )

See for installation instructions and necessary init.d-script
  http://redmine.lighttpd.net/wiki/1/LighttpdOnSolaris

The bundled SMF-descriptor already uses the following descriptor:

# =======================================================================================    
Configure conf.ini.php to suit your needs.

In current versions, there are no scripts shipped anymore. Instead everything is in conf.ini.php.
But feel free to continue using scripts, this feature is not deprecated.

Make the scripts readable and executable:
  chmod 0755 /path/to/SolarStatus/scripts/*
  
# =======================================================================================  
For SMART-commands you need to setuid smartctl with
  chown u+s smartctl
Please see for security risks: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid
Short explanation: Every user of the system (read: logged on user, not via smb/nfs or such)
 can run the setuid'ed smartctl with root-privileges and can secure erase your disks.
 DO AT YOUR OWN RISK! However, recommended :)

# =======================================================================================
/path/to/SolarStatus/extra contains the alerter.py python-script which is meant to be executed as a cronjob.
It's job is to check your services (SMF), check the ZFS Pool State and your S.M.A.R.T. state and mail you in case of failure.
It needs to be configured, so please edit it.

To activate the alerter, register it as root in the root's crontab:
  su
  export EDITOR=nano
  crontab -e
insert (exemplary, edit as you like):
  # 3am, every day, check status
  0 3 * * * python /path/to/SolarStatus/extra/alerter.py


Have fun, feedback appreciated
